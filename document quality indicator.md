# document quality indicator
##
- You consider 3 things
	- abstract quality
	- factor of the quality
	- metric for the factor. 
- If we want to know how complete a documentation is then we can check for (completeness, coverage of the problem, %coverage) 
- (usability, readability, gunning fog index/readability score)
	- If we want something to be usable then we need it to be readable and that can be measured by the readability score.
- You would need a lot of DQIâ€™s to check for everything.
